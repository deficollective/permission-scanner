- permission scanner
  - filter out functions without any permissions
    - combined check on msg.sender_conditions & modifiers
    - check on visibility?
    - collect a set of variables that need to be retrieved
- find a way to customise storage reader
  - output form?
  - call flow? (parallise it, batch it)
    - does it a etherscan call for every variable? (probably only once to create a compiled version with initiating Slither() )
    - is there a way to batch multiple get_storageAt() ?
